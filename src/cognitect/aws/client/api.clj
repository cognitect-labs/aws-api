(defn client
  "Given a config map, create a client for specified api. Supported keys:

  :api                  - required, name of the api you want to interact with e.g. s3, cloudformation, etc
  :http-client          - optional, to share http-clients across aws-clients
                          Default: default-http-client
  :region-provider      - optional, implementation of aws-clojure.region/RegionProvider
                          protocol, defaults to cognitect.aws.region/default-region-provider.
                          Ignored if :region is also provided
  :region               - optional, the aws region serving the API endpoints you
                          want to interact with, defaults to region provided by
                          by the region-provider
  :credentials-provider - optional, implementation of
                          cognitect.aws.credentials/CredentialsProvider protocol
                          Default: cognitect.aws.credentials/default-credentials-provider
  :endpoint-override    - optional, map to override parts of the endpoint. Supported keys:
                            :protocol     - :http or :https
                            :hostname     - string
                            :port         - int
                            :path         - string
                          If the hostname includes an AWS region, be sure to use the same
                          region for the client (either via out of process configuration
                          or the :region key supplied to this fn).
                          Also supports a string representing just the hostname, though
                          support for a string is deprecated and may be removed in the
                          future.
  :retriable?           - optional, predicate fn of http-response (see cognitect.aws.http/submit),
                          which should return a truthy value if the request is
                          retriable.
                          Default: cognitect.aws.retry/default-retriable?
  :backoff              - optional, fn of number of retries so far. Should return
                          number of milliseconds to wait before the next retry
                          (if the request is retriable?), or nil if it should stop.
                          Default: cognitect.aws.retry/default-backoff.

  By default, all clients use shared http-client, credentials-provider, and
  region-provider instances which use a small collection of daemon threads.

  Primarily for debugging, clients support keyword access for :api (String), :region, :endpoint,
  :credentials, :service (with :metadata), and :http-client.
